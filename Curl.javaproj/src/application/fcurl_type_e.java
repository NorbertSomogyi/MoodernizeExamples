 *
 * This example source code introduces a c library buffered I/O interface to
 * URL reads it supports fopen(), fread(), fgets(), feof(), fclose(),
 * rewind(). Supported functions have identical prototypes to their normal c
 * lib namesakes and are preceaded by url_ .
 *
 * Using this code you can replace your program's fopen() with url_fopen()
 * and fread() with url_fread() and it become possible to read remote streams
 * instead of (only) local files. Local files (ie those that can be directly
 * fopened) will drop back to using the underlying clib implementations
 *
 * See the main() function at the bottom that shows an app that retrieves from
 * a specified url using fgets() and fread() and saves as two output files.
