/*
   gun [ -t ] [ name ... ]

   decompresses the data in the named gzip files.  If no arguments are given,
   gun will decompress from stdin to stdout.  The names must end in .gz, -gz,
   .z, -z, _z, or .Z.  The uncompressed data will be written to a file name
   with the suffix stripped.  On success, the original file is deleted.  On
   failure, the output file is deleted.  For most failures, the command will
   continue to process the remaining names on the command line.  A memory
   allocation failure will abort the command.  If -t is specified, then the
   listed files or stdin will be tested as gzip files for integrity (without
   checking for a proper suffix), no output will be written, and no files
   will be deleted.

   Like gzip, gun allows concatenated gzip streams and will decompress them,
   writing all of the uncompressed data to the output.  Unlike gzip, gun allows
   an empty file on input, and will produce no error writing an empty output
   file.

   gun will also decompress files made by Unix compress, which uses LZW
   compression.  These files are automatically detected by virtue of their
   magic header bytes.  Since the end of Unix compress stream is marked by the
   end-of-file, they cannot be concantenated.  If a Unix compress stream is
   encountered in an input file, it is the last stream in that file.

   Like gunzip and uncompress, the file attributes of the original compressed
   file are maintained in the final uncompressed file, to the extent that the
   user permissions allow it.

   On my Mac OS X PowerPC G4, gun is almost twice as fast as gunzip (version
   1.2.4) is on the same file, when gun is linked with zlib 1.2.2.  Also the
   LZW decompression provided by gun is about twice as fast as the standard
   Unix uncompress command.
