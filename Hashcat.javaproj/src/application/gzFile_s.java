     This library supports reading and writing files in gzip (.gz) format with
   an interface similar to that of stdio, using the functions that start with
   "gz".  The gzip format is different from the zlib format.  gzip is a gzip
   wrapper, documented in RFC 1952, wrapped around a deflate stream.

ZEXTERN gzFile ZEXPORT gzopen OF((const char *path, const char *mode));

     Opens a gzip (.gz) file for reading or writing.  The mode parameter is as
   in fopen ("rb" or "wb") but can also include a compression level ("wb9") or
   a strategy: 'f' for filtered data as in "wb6f", 'h' for Huffman-only
   compression as in "wb1h", 'R' for run-length encoding as in "wb1R", or 'F'
   for fixed code compression as in "wb9F".  (See the description of
   deflateInit2 for more information about the strategy parameter.)  'T' will
   request transparent writing or appending with no compression and not using
   the gzip format.

     "a" can be used instead of "w" to request that the gzip stream that will
   be written be appended to the file.  "+" will result in an error, since
   reading and writing to the same gzip file is not supported.  The addition of
   "x" when writing will create the file exclusively, which fails if the file
   already exists.  On systems that support it, the addition of "e" when
   reading or writing will set the flag to close the file on an execve() call.

     These functions, as well as gzip, will read and decode a sequence of gzip
   streams in a file.  The append function of gzopen() can be used to create
   such a file.  (Also see gzflush() for another way to do this.)  When
   appending, gzopen does not test whether the file begins with a gzip stream,
   nor does it look for the end of the gzip streams to begin appending.  gzopen
   will simply append a gzip stream to the existing file.

     gzopen can be used to read a file which is not in gzip format; in this
   case gzread will directly read from the file without decompression.  When
   reading, this will be detected automatically by looking for the magic two-
   byte gzip header.

     gzopen returns NULL if the file could not be opened, if there was
   insufficient memory to allocate the gzFile state, or if an invalid mode was
   specified (an 'r', 'w', or 'a' was not provided, or '+' was provided).
   errno can be checked to determine if the reason gzopen failed was that the
   file could not be opened.
