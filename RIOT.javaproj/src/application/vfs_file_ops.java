/**
 * @defgroup  sys_vfs Virtual File System (VFS) layer
 * @ingroup   sys
 * @brief     Provides an interface for accessing files and directories from
 *            different devices and file systems
 *
 * This layer is modeled as a mix between POSIX syscalls (e.g. open) and the
 * Linux VFS layer implementation, with major reductions in the feature set, in
 * order to fit the resource constrained platforms that RIOT targets.
 *
 * The overall design goals are:
 * - Provide implementations for all newlib "file" syscalls
 * - Keep it simple, do not add every possible file operation from Linux VFS.
 * - Easy to map existing file system implementations for resource constrained systems onto the VFS layer API
 * - Avoid keeping a central `enum` of all file system drivers that has to be kept up to date with external packages etc.
 * - Use POSIX `<errno.h>` numbers as negative return codes for errors, avoid the global `errno` variable.
 * - Only absolute paths to files (no per-process working directory)
 * - No dynamic memory allocation
 *
 *
 * The API should be easy to understand for users who are familiar with the
 * POSIX file functions (open, close, read, write, fstat, lseek etc.)
 *
 * The VFS layer keeps track of mounted file systems and open files, the
 * `vfs_open` function searches the array of mounted file systems and dispatches
 * the call to the file system instance with the longest matching mount point prefix.
 * Subsequent calls to `vfs_read`, `vfs_write`, etc will do a look up in the
 * table of open files and dispatch the call to the correct file system driver
 * for handling.
 *
 * `vfs_mount` takes a string containing the mount point, a file system driver
 * specification (`struct file_system`), and an opaque pointer that only the FS
 * driver knows how to use, which can be used to keep driver parameters in order
 * to allow dynamic handling of multiple devices.
 *
 * @todo VFS layer reference counting and locking for open files and
 *       simultaneous access.
