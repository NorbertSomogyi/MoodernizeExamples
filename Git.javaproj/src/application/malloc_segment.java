/* ---------------------------- malloc_state ----------------------------- */
/*
   A malloc_state holds all of the bookkeeping for a space.
   The main fields are:

  Top
    The topmost chunk of the currently active segment. Its size is
    cached in topsize.  The actual size of topmost space is
    topsize+TOP_FOOT_SIZE, which includes space reserved for adding
    fenceposts and segment records if necessary when getting more
    space from the system.  The size at which to autotrim top is
    cached from mparams in trim_check, except that it is disabled if
    an autotrim fails.

  Designated victim (dv)
    This is the preferred chunk for servicing small requests that
    don't have exact fits.  It is normally the chunk split off most
    recently to service another small request.  Its size is cached in
    dvsize. The link fields of this chunk are not maintained since it
    is not kept in a bin.

  SmallBins
    An array of bin headers for free chunks.  These bins hold chunks
    with sizes less than MIN_LARGE_SIZE bytes. Each bin contains
    chunks of all the same size, spaced 8 bytes apart.  To simplify
    use in double-linked lists, each bin header acts as a malloc_chunk
    pointing to the real first node, if it exists (else pointing to
    itself).  This avoids special-casing for headers.  But to avoid
    waste, we allocate only the fd/bk pointers of bins, and then use
    repositioning tricks to treat these as the fields of a chunk.

  TreeBins
    Treebins are pointers to the roots of trees holding a range of
    sizes. There are 2 equally spaced treebins for each power of two
    from TREE_SHIFT to TREE_SHIFT+16. The last bin holds anything
    larger.

  Bin maps
    There is one bit map for small bins ("smallmap") and one for
    treebins ("treemap).  Each bin sets its bit when non-empty, and
    clears the bit when empty.  Bit operations are then used to avoid
    bin-by-bin searching -- nearly all "search" is done without ever
    looking at bins that won't be selected.  The bit maps
    conservatively use 32 bits per map word, even if on 64bit system.
    For a good description of some of the bit-based techniques used
    here, see Henry S. Warren Jr's book "Hacker's Delight" (and
    supplement at http://hackersdelight.org/). Many of these are
    intended to reduce the branchiness of paths through malloc etc, as
    well as to reduce the number of memory locations read or written.

  Segments
    A list of segments headed by an embedded malloc_segment record
    representing the initial space.

  Address check support
    The least_addr field is the least address ever obtained from
    MORECORE or MMAP. Attempted frees and reallocs of any address less
    than this are trapped (unless INSECURE is defined).

  Magic tag
    A cross-check field that should always hold same value as mparams.magic.

  Flags
    Bits recording whether to use MMAP, locks, or contiguous MORECORE

  Statistics
    Each space keeps track of current and maximum system memory
    obtained via MORECORE or MMAP.

  Trim support
    Fields holding the amount of unused topmost memory that should trigger
    timming, and a counter to force periodic scanning to release unused
    non-topmost segments.

  Locking
    If USE_LOCKS is defined, the "mutex" lock is acquired and released
    around every public call using this mspace.

  Extension support
    A void* pointer and a size_t field that can be used to help implement
    extensions to this malloc.
